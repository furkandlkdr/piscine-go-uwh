# Uniworkhub Piscine Program - GoLang Exam and Quest Solutions

This repository contains a collection of important code solutions from the "Piscine" program by Uniworkhub, a software school that focuses on teaching GoLang. The **Piscine** program includes a series of **checkpoint**(exams) and **quests** designed to test and improve problem-solving skills in GoLang.

## Contents

In this repository, you will find solutions to various GoLang challenges, including:

- **Exam Solutions**: Key code implementations for important exams, showcasing essential concepts and problem-solving techniques.
- **Quest Solutions**: Step-by-step code for various quests that progressively build GoLang knowledge and skills.

## Goals

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Share efficient and well-structured solutions to GoLang challenges from the Piscine program.
- Serve as a reference for future learners who are looking to deepen their understanding of GoLang through practical examples.
- Highlight important GoLang programming concepts such as concurrency, error handling, and data structures.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `exam-x/`: Contains exam code with problem descriptions and solutions.
- `quest-x/`: Contains quest solutions..

## How to Use
